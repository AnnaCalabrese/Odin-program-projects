## The project
This is the second project of the Odin Project curriculum for web developers: 
- Build a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch. 
- Create a 16x16 grid of square divs in javascript.
- Set up a “hover” effect so that the grid divs change color when your mouse passes over them, leaving a (pixelated) trail through your grid like a pen would.  
- Add a button to the top of the screen which will clear the current grid


### View Live
I deployed this completed challenge on Netlify:
https://odin-sketch-project.netlify.app/

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Vanilla javascript


### What I learned
This was a challenging website for me to build and it took me a couple of days because I got stuck with creating the 16x16 grid in js.
I feel like I'm getting more familiar with loops!

### What should I focus on in the future to improve my skills (how can I become a better programmer)?
I realized I should not immediately get into code and focus first on solving the problem. 
I want to make great use of pseudo-code and improve my problem solving skills to be more efficient but I can't do it if I always want to do things quickly, in the future I'll take things slowly and with more patience.
